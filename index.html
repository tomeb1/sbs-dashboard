    <!-- Chosen Palette: Strategic Neutrals -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A dynamic, single-page dashboard. The main view provides a high-level overview with summary KPIs, two charts (priority and location distribution), and a fully searchable/filterable list of all prospects. This allows for quick identification of key targets. Clicking any prospect transitions the view to a detailed "dossier" page for that specific contact, presenting the in-depth analysis and strategic outreach plan from the report. This two-level structure (overview -> detail) was chosen to mirror a salesperson's natural workflow: first identify who to contact, then review the specific strategy. It prevents information overload and makes the intelligence highly actionable. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        1. KPI Cards: Goal=Inform. Method=Styled HTML. Interaction=None. Justification=Provide immediate, top-line metrics.
        2. Priority Distribution: Goal=Compare/Inform. Method=Donut Chart (Chart.js/Canvas). Interaction=Hover tooltips. Justification=Instantly show the quality mix of the prospect list.
        3. Geographic Distribution: Goal=Relationships/Inform. Method=Bar Chart (Chart.js/Canvas). Interaction=Hover tooltips. Justification=Visualize key geographic clusters without the complexity of a map library.
        4. Prospect List: Goal=Organize/Filter. Method=Interactive HTML table. Interaction=Clickable rows, text search, dropdown filters. Justification=The core tool for navigating and segmenting the prospect data.
        5. Prospect Dossier: Goal=Detail/Inform. Method=Dynamically populated HTML content block. Interaction=Activated by click, with a close button. Justification=Provides the deep-dive intelligence on-demand, keeping the main interface clean and focused.
        6. Gemini Email Generation: Goal=Action. Method=API call on button click within dossier. Justification=Turns insight into immediate, actionable outreach.
        7. Gemini Summary Generation: Goal=Synthesize. Method=API call on button click on main dashboard. Justification=Provides a high-level strategic overview of the entire dataset.

            <p><strong>Strategic Implications:</strong> Faith Technologies is a prime candidate for infrastructure-led sales. Their expertise in large-scale electrical projects makes them perfectly suited for Winnie's ruggedized solutions and PureNet's high-performance cabling. The Arteco pitch should be framed as a high-value technology offering that can be seamlessly added to their existing portfolio.</p>

            <h4>Prospect & Company Snapshot</h4>
            <p><strong>Contact Validation:</strong> Email mmayes@honorsecurity.co. A critical data discrepancy exists: CRM lists Green Bay, WI, but all web evidence (website, phone area code) points to a Michigan-based operation. This must be clarified.</p>
            <p><strong>Role & Inferred Responsibilities:</strong> As the Founder, Mike Mayes is the principal decision-maker.</p>
            <h4>Corporate Intelligence & Technology Profile</h4>
            <p><strong>Services & Solutions Analysis:</strong> Website lists a full suite of services including "Cloud-Based Security Systems" and "Structured Cabling."</p>
            <p><strong>Identified Technology Partners & Stack:</strong> No specific partners are listed on their website. This is a significant "greenfield" opportunity with no entrenched competitor to displace.</p>
            <p><strong>Target Vertical Markets:</strong> A key highlighted project is with Star of the West Milling Co., a major player in the agricultural industry. This suggests expertise in a harsh environment vertical.</p>
            <h4>Relationship & Opportunity Analysis</h4>
            <p><strong>Identified Trigger Event & Hook:</strong> The need to tactfully resolve the geographic discrepancy is an immediate, rapport-building hook. The Star of the West project is a powerful secondary hook to show tailored research.</p>
            <p><strong>SBS Product Alignment Score:</strong> Winnie Industries: High (due to agricultural project), PureNet: High (listed as a service), Arteco: Medium.</p>
            <p><strong>Strategic Implications:</strong> This appears to be a smaller, relationship-focused integrator. They can become very loyal partners if given good support. The lack of advertised partners is a golden opportunity to become their go-to supplier.</p>

            <p><strong>Contact Validation:</strong> Critical data correction: The company's main office is in Janesville, WI, not Schaumburg, IL. Jim Sjoblom is the Owner/CEO.</p>
            <p><strong>Company Profile:</strong> A well-established integrator with 20+ years of experience. Their value proposition is built on custom solutions and robust support.</p>
            <h4>Corporate Intelligence & Technology Profile</h4>
            <p><strong>Services & Solutions Analysis:</strong> A key finding is their focus on a managed services model. They are a "Hattrix Managed Service Provider (MSP)," indicating a business strategy heavily invested in Recurring Monthly Revenue (RMR).</p>
            <p><strong>Identified Technology Partners & Stack:</strong> The website explicitly states they partner with <strong>Exacq</strong> for surveillance solutions. Exacq is a direct competitor to Arteco. This is a competitive displacement opportunity.</p>
            <h4>Relationship & Opportunity Analysis</h4>
            <p><strong>Relationship History & Context:</strong> Prior outreach focused on a "winnie info/sample offer."</p>
            <p><strong>Identified Trigger Event & Hook:</strong> The most powerful hook is RWT's established RMR business model with Hattrix. The conversation must be framed around extending that successful strategy to video.</p>
            <p><strong>SBS Product Alignment Score:</strong> Arteco: Medium-High (challenge is displacement, opportunity is VSaaS model), Winnie Industries: High, PureNet: High.</p>
            <p><strong>Strategic Implications:</strong> Do not sell product features vs. Exacq. Sell a superior business model. Position Arteco as the engine for a profitable Video-Surveillance-as-a-Service (VSaaS) offering that they cannot easily build with Exacq. The AI analytics become new, billable monthly services.</p>

            <p><strong>Strategic Implication:</strong> All outreach to this individual and associated contact information must cease immediately.

            <ul>
                <li>The CRM record for George Stanil must be marked as deceased and archived.</li>
                <li>The opportunity shifts from contacting a known individual to identifying the new leadership or ownership of Stanil Security.</li>
                <li>Research is required to determine if the company is still in operation and who the current decision-makers are.</li>
                <li>The original premise—that a newer company needs to establish foundational manufacturer partnerships—may still be valid, but the target contact is incorrect.</li>

            <p><strong>Relationship History & Context:</strong> A follow-up is needed after a prior outreach. The contact is relatively cold.</p>
            <p><strong>Identified Trigger Event & Hook:</strong> A company blog post features Tim Cook servicing cameras in harsh weather. This provides a personalized hook that speaks to his hands-on approach and the critical importance of equipment reliability.</p>

            <p><strong>Strategic Implications:</strong> A hands-on leader like Tim will have low tolerance for unreliable products. The sales message must be grounded in reliability and durability.

            <h4>Relationship & Opportunity Analysis</h4>
            <p><strong>Relationship History & Context:</strong> This is a warm channel partner relationship, not a cold lead. The CRM notes a previous in-person business lunch in October and his coverage of the Chicago area.</p>
            <h4>Strategic Implications:</h4>
            <p>A face-to-face meeting with a distributor BDM is a significant investment. The goal now is to build on that foundation and move beyond product sales (like the "wire sale") to a strategic partnership. As a distributor, Graybar is a gateway to hundreds of smaller integrators.</p>
            <h4>Strategic Outreach Plan & Recommendations</h4>
            <p><strong>Priority Level:</strong> 🔴 Hot</p>
            <p><strong>Recommended Next Action:</strong> Phone Call.</p>
            <p><strong>Primary Message Theme & Talking Points:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reference the enjoyable lunch meeting in October to re-establish the personal connection.</li>
                <li>"Phil, I want to move our conversation beyond just wire sales and talk about a more strategic partnership in the Chicago area."</li>
                <li>"How can I help you and your sales team bring the full SBS portfolio (Arteco, Winnie) to your integrator customers?"</li>
                <li>Offer to do joint sales calls, provide lunch-and-learn training for his team, or create co-branded marketing materials.</li>
